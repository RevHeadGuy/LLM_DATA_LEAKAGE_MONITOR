# llm-data-leakage-monitor


A Chrome extension that detects and blocks sensitive data (PII, secrets, credentials, etc.) in real time using both advanced regex patterns and an offline BERT-tiny NER model, running entirely in your browser.
It helps prevent accidental data leakage when using LLMs (like ChatGPT) or any web-based ML model interface.
